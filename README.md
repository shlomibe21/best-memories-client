# Best Memories

## Description
Best Memories is a mobile and desktop fully-responsive web application that allows users to cherry pick their best photos and short videos and create an online album that is easy to access and manage, that contains only their best memories.
Users can also make personal albums for family members or friends for a special event or just for fun and share it with them.

## Motivation
We all have plenty of digital photos stored somewhere on our hard drive, phone, or the cloud. But it is always hard to go back and find the pictures that we really like. Best Memories was created to help with this matter. Users can easily upload media files like photos and short videos to the cloud (stored on AWS S3) and create different albums for different events, occasions, or subjects with the option to add a unique name and comments to each album and to each media file.
